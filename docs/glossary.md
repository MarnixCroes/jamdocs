of JoinMarket without a little bit of special lingo.

JoinMarket.

### Jar

In Jam, a "jar" is a container that holds some sats of yours.[^mixdepths] Jars
exist to segregate your sats into multiple buckets that are disconnected from
each other, which aids privacy. To not risk any privacy degradation, you can
only spend from one jar at a time.

There are five jars by default. The default jar to receive funds is the first
one.

[^mixdepths]: What we call "jars" are called "mixdepths" in JoinMarket. They are also referred to as "pockets" in some of the older parts of the JoinMarket documentation.
