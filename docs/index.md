# Getting Started

Welcome, stranger! The goal of Jam is to make it easier to improve the financial
privacy of yourself and others.

Both Jam and its documentation are a work in progress. We are writing
these docs as we progress, out in the open. If you want to help, please
do!

Jam is an interface for JoinMarket. What sets JoinMarket apart is that it has no
single point of failure. It is completely peer-to-peer, there is no central
coordinator, no "doxxic change", no company behind it all, no marketing
department, and no central entity making any money off of it.

All development is done by volunteers. Consequently, please heed the following
warning:

    **Jam is considered beta software.** While JoinMarket is tried and tested, Jam is new and things might break. Use with caution. Please report any issues [directly on GitHub](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/joinmarket-webui/issues/new).
