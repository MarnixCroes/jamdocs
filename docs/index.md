# Getting Started

The goal of Jam is to make it easier to improve the financial privacy of
yourself and others.

Both Jam and its documentation are a work in progress. We are writing
these docs as we progress, out in the open. If you want to help, please
do!

Jam is an interface for JoinMarket. What sets JoinMarket apart is that it has no
single point of failure. It is completely peer-to-peer, there is no central
coordinator, no "doxxic change", no company behind it all, no marketing
department, and no central entity making any money off of it.

All development is done by volunteers. Consequently, please heed the following
warning:

!!! warning
    **Jam is considered beta software.** While JoinMarket is tried and tested, Jam is new and things might break. Use with caution. Please report any issues [directly on GitHub](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/joinmarket-webui/issues/new).

## Installation

The easiest way to install Jam is via one of the full-node software solutions
that includes Jam as an app or plug-in. You can also install it manually
yourself.

## Getting Help

Since there is no company or fixed team behind Jam or JoinMarket, your best bet
to get help are public chat groups and public forums. Also make sure to have a
look at the FAQ to get answers to frequently asked questions.
