# Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute: testing, sharing ideas, writing
documentation, creating tutorials, and—of course—writing code.

This is a [free and open-source](license.md) software project and we love
receiving pull-requests, bug reports, ideas, and feedback from everyone. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] for how to get started participating in this project.

Also make sure to join or listen to the recordings of our [community
