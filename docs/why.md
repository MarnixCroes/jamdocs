## Why Care About Privacy?

## Why Jam?

Jam is a front-end for [JoinMarket][jmcs], a privacy-focused bitcoin software that
uses a peer-to-peer marketplace to facilitate collaborative transactions.

A collaborative transaction, as the name implies, is a bitcoin transaction that
is done collaboratively by multiple parties. The tricky part of getting a
collaborative transactions done is not technical, but social. It is a problem of
matchmaking, timing, and trust.

Usually, this problem is solved with a central coordinator.

JoinMarket takes a different approach. It allows participants to propose
collaborative transactions to others, creating an open market of buyers and
sellers, which removes the central coordinator from the equation.
