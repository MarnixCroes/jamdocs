# Free Software

Jam is free as in *freedom*. We believe that free software is an imperative for
a free society, which is why Jam is released under a free software [license].

>  “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
>  Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute,
>  study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of
>  liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as
>  in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.”

Both Bitcoin and JoinMarket are free software, and for good reason.
