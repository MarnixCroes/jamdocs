# Fees

Fees play a crucial role in the incentive structure of both Bitcoin and
JoinMarket. They form the basis for the economic incentives of both systems. In
Bitcoin, you pay fees to a miner in order for your transaction to be included in
a block. The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the higher the likelihood
that your transaction will be included quickly.

In JoinMarket, you pay fees to [market makers][maker] in order to use their
liquidity to your advantage.

Consequently, when you are sending a collaborative transaction in Jam—or when you are using the scheduler to do multiple transactions—you have to pay fees to miners and makers. How high these fees are depends on market and [mempool][mempool] conditions.

Of course, you can offer liquidity yourself via the [Earn][earn] functionality, allowing you to be on the receiving end of maker fees.
