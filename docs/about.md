# About

Jam is a [free and open-source](license.md) project that aims to improve the
financial privacy of yourself and others, without relying on a trusted third
party. It was [started in 2021][bounty] by various volunteers and is still
developed and maintained on a volunteer basis. Jam is a front-end for
[JoinMarket][jmcs], a privacy-focused bitcoin software that uses a peer-to-peer
marketplace to facilitate collaborative transactions.

The name "Jam" is a backronym, stands for [*JoinMarket's Awesome, Man*][name],
and shouldn't be taken too seriously.
